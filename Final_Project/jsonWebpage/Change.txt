It was released on October 17, 2022.\n\n== Description ==\nThings take a turn for the dark with “Change”. This is where Minnie and Yuqi’s contributions start to appear, deviating from the brashness that is Soyeon’s signature into something more vulnerable. I Love shifts from (G)I-DLE being in control to being at the mercy of their own emotions, driven to desperate actions out of a need to be loved.\n\n“Change” is the album standout, acting as the dark mirror of “Love”. Here, the reality of fame has set in–that it doesn’t mean much, and it will not last. The pre-chorus is devastating– a Yuqi and Miyeon tag-team, using their lower registers to add a haunting quality as they admit that fame and fans are not enough to sustain someone emotionally. This is compounded by the sharp knowledge that nothing lasts forever, and one day even this love will be gone. Paired with an aggressive beat, the quiet and quick delivery creates an air that is melancholy and terror-stricken. Caught up in the fears of it ending and having no one there anymore, (G)I-DLE are no longer able to enjoy their success.<ref>[https://seoulbeats.com/2022/10/gi-dle-examine-the-dark-side-of-love-in-i-love/ SeoulBeats\' Website]</ref>\n\n{{Quote|(Grins) Well, everyone come and ask, how happy I\'m with my life that I have...
