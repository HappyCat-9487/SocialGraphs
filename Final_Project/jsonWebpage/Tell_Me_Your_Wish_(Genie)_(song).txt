The song was first released online on June 22, 2009 and the group\'s first performance was at \'\'Music Bank\'\' on June 26, 2009. The song was later included in their second studio album \'\'[[Oh! (album)|Oh!]]\'\' and its repackage \'\'[[Run Devil Run (album)|Run Devil Run]]\'\', before its release in Japan.\n\n==Song Information==\n\nThe song was composed by the Norwegian songwriting-production company Dsign Music and was originally titled "I Just Wanna Dance." [[S.M. Entertainment]] purchased the rights to the song and the Korean lyrics were re-written by Yoo Young Jin, whom also added additional composition to the track; Yoo Han Jin re-arranged the song. The song was described as an electro pop track in the Eurodance style and was a departure from their previous track "[[Gee (song)|Gee]]" which relied heavily on the hook music style.\n\n==Music Video==\nAll three music videos featured Girls’ Generation’s "Marine Girl" concept and was choreographed by Rino Nakasone Razalan; parts of the choreography, "Jegi-kicking dance" (제기차기 춤) and the "Leg-beauty dance" (각선미 춤) became popular with the Korean public. \n\n=== \'\'\'Original\'\'\' ===\nThe music video portrayed what the song was lyrically about Girls’ Generation asking their boyfriend to tell them their wish because they are his genie. It begins with [[Yoona]] sitting on a large lamp, followed by separate scenes from the first person perspective of the boyfriend entering three separate rooms of [[Jessica]], [[Yoona]], and [[Yuri]] in a pink bedroom setting, [[Tiffany]], [[Taeyeon]], and [[Sunny]] in a club, and [[Hyoyeon]], [[Seohyun]], and [[Sooyoung]] in a room from which Seohyun bursts out of a large cake. There is then two separate group stages where on one stage, they perform the choreography in their white uniforms while on the other they perform in their brown uniforms.\nThe MV was released online on January 26, 2010. \n\n=== \'\'\'3D version\'\'\' ===\nOn October 24, 2010, a 3D music video of the Korean version, was released for Samsung PAVV LED TV. The video begins with all nine girls sitting down, looking into crystal balls, then cutting into the beginning of the song with "Girls Generation" written in pink, sparkly lettering. The video features three dance sequences, one of which features a floor with cosmic-like sparkles coming out of it. During the video, it cuts to solo scenes of the girls playing with the crystal balls, inside are a man and a woman standing awkwardly beside each other at a bus stop, beside them is a poster with "I Wish" printed on it, and a red Mini Convertible is below it. The girls are then seen changing the couples clothes, and making the Mini appear out of the poster, signifying the girls are \'genies\' and granting their wishes. The video ends with the girls waving goodbye to the couple, who then drive off in the car, with the number \'37\' printed on the side.\n\nThe outfits worn by the girls for this version follow the military/marine girl concept, with two costumes being used, similar to the original video. While the all white costume with navy-esque hat reappear, the black coat, tie, short-shorts, and white undershirt replaces the khaki uniforms.\n\n=== \'\'\'Japanese version\'\'\' ===\nThe music video teaser was released August 16, 2010, and the full music video was released August 25, 2010, it was also their first video to be filmed in Japan. It begins with a young boy (EXO\'s Chanyeol) who found an old lamp and a scale model of a circus tent in an old attic. After rubbing the lamp, the camera zooms inside the tent where the Girls\' Generation can be seen coming to life as the song begins to play. The girls then alternately switch to different costumes as the boy rubs the lamp once again, where in they are seen on an old television screen with a huge candy cane and colorful balloons. The music video ends with the boy rubbing the lamp again before magically disappearing into another scene where he is walking out of a limousine with Girls\' Generation members meeting him on the red carpet at a premiere event. It is implied that his wish had been granted by lamp. There are also individual close-up scenes of members dressed in old fashioned pink shirts.\n\nMost of the choreography remains the same as the Korean version, with a slight tweak to some of the steps. The difference is that in the Japanese version there are some parts where member Taeyeon moves to the front position to sing her solo verse before going back and rejoining the other girls to form a line. While in the Korean version, Taeyeon does not do this. Also, all the girls pose with a hand salute at the end. In the Korean version, only member Seohyun does it as her "end pose". A dance version was also released which features the girls wearing their brown soldier uniforms which were one of the costumes that they wore in the music video.{{Clear}}\n==Lyrics==\n{{Lyrics\n|content=\n{{ColorGroup|SNSD/9}}\n<tabber>\nHangul=\n<poem>\nThat\'s right, come on\n\n{{ColorLyrics|Taeyeon|소원을 말해 봐\n니 맘속에 있는 작은 꿈을 말해
