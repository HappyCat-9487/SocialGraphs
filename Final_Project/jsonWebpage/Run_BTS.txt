When the meeting turns into a heated argument, moderator Nam-joon decides that each dormer should contribute an idea.<br/>\nSeok-jin proposes the rule: \'\'Do not put makeup products in the refrigerator.\'\' A flashback shows him opening the refrigerator, only to find it filled with makeup products, leaving little space for food. When the dormers become divided on the rule, Yoon-gi suggests having a separate fridge for cosmetics.<br/>\nNext, Ji-min suggests the rule: \'\'Do not put your belongings in others’ room.\'\' In a flashback, Tae-hyung leaves a stuffed toy and a heart-shaped lamp in Seok-jin and Ji-min\'s rooms respectively. Tae-hyung insists it is simply his way of sharing things with them. Yoon-gi points out that Nam-joon also does the same. In another flashback, Nam-joon leaves a sweater in Yoon-gi\'s room after a failed shopping attempt; Yoon-gi, finding the sweater is not his size, then leaves it in Ho-seok\'s room.<br/>\nSince the dormers agree that sharing things is good for them, Ho-seok suggests canceling Ji-min\'s rule and offers his own: \'\'Tidy up after yourself.\'\' In a flashback, he finds Ji-min sleeping in his room and messing up his clothes. In another instance, he wakes up to find clothes and ice cream wrappers littering the floor, and the culprits—Jung-kook, Tae-hyung, and Nam-joon—idling in the common room and watching TV, while eating more ice cream.<br/>\nThis leads to Ji-min reminding the group to put their shoes in order, which causes Seok-jin to vehemently complain about the lack of space in the dorm. When Tae-hyung mutters Jung-kook\'s name in response, the next rule is laid out: \'\'Bring an adequate amount of belongings.\'\' A flashback reveals Jung-kook\'s habit of bringing multiple random objects into the dorm.<br/>\nThe doorbell rings suddenly, and Yoon-gi announces that he ordered chicken for their lunch. Everyone excitedly rushes out to collect the food, without deciding when the rules will go into effect.}} is aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/run-bts-episode-77-recap-funny-moments/|title=Run BTS!\' episode 77: The moments from \'Food Guest 1\' that cracked us up|last=Field|first=Sonya|website=Hypable|access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref>\n| LineColor           = lightpink\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 78\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 21\n| Aux1                = "Food Guest" (Part 1)\n| Aux2                = Jin\n| Aux3                = Team Kim Seok-jin {{small|(J-Hope, Jimin, & V)}} \'\'\'·\'\'\' Team Seok-jin Kim {{small|(RM, Suga, & Jungkook)}}\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|06|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = BTS play multiple rounds of food guessing games to win lunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/run-bts-episode-78-recap-funny-moments/|title=\'Run BTS!\' episode 78 funniest moments: Return of the bunny hats|last=Field|first=Sonya|website=Hypable|access-date=September 20, 2021}}</ref>\n| LineColor           = lightpink\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 79\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 22\n| Aux1                = "Food Guest" (Part 2)\n| Aux2                = Jin\n| Aux3                =  Team Kim Seok-jin {{small|(J-Hope, Jimin, & V)}} \'\'\'·\'\'\' Team Seok-jin Kim {{small|(RM, Suga, & Jungkook)}}\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|07|02}}\n| ShortSummary        = BTS play three final rounds of food-related games.
