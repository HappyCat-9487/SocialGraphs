The camera then zooms in through his fingers to reveal the seven band members seated in a barren desert, in the same order as seen in the 2014 "Just One Day" music video. [[Kim Seok-jin|Jin]] is seen in the truck he previously used in "[[Run (BTS song)|Run]]"\'s music video, facing the angel statue from "[[Blood Sweat & Tears (song)|Blood Sweat & Tears]]." The old brown piano from [[Suga (rapper)|Suga\'s]] "First Love" short film also makes an appearance. The blue container trailer that [[RM (rapper)|RM]] had passed in "Run" is now in front of him, and [[J-Hope]] is standing alongside the train from "[[Spring Day (song)|Spring Day]]" on the dunes. BTS\' first chapter ends where it began nine years ago, as the boys stand together in front of the bus. Where [[V (singer)|V]] covered Jin\'s eyes with his hands in the music video for "Blood Sweat & Tears," six years later, in "Yet to Come," Jin removes his hands to present to V the symbol of BTS\' beginning — the yellow school bus from their very first music video, "No More Dream." They don dazzling white clothes that complement their happy looks instead of the dark and heavy makeup they wore nine years before. The septet is back on the bus, seated in the same configuration as in "Spring Day," and ready to head to their next destination, which has not yet been reached.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220613000796|title=[Album Review] BTS\' \'Proof\' offers throwback to past, invitation to future|last=Choi|first=Ji-won|date=June 13, 2022|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|access-date=September 6, 2022}}</ref>\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn South Korea, "Yet to Come" debuted at number 13 on the Week 24 issue of [[Circle Digital Chart|Gaon Digital Chart]] as the highest-charting new entry for the period dated June 5–11.<ref>{{cite web |title=Digital Chart -
