It was written by [[Bang Si-hyuk|"Hitman" Bang]], Kim Do-hoon, [[RM (rapper)|RM]], [[Suga (rapper)|Suga]], [[J-Hope]], and Pdogg, with the latter of the six solely handling production. The Korean version was released on October 10, 2016, as the [[lead single]] from the band\'s second [[studio album]], \'\'[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]\'\' (2016), by [[Big Hit Entertainment]]. The Japanese version of the song was released on May 10, 2017, through [[Universal Music Japan]], as a [[single album]] that included the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] tracks "[[Spring Day (song)|Spring Day]]" and "[[Not Today (BTS song)|Not Today]]", both also in Japanese. It is a [[moombahton]], [[trap music|trap]], and [[tropical house]] song with influences of [[dancehall]] and [[reggaeton]]. The song\'s lyrics address the pain of addictive love.\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who were favourable towards its production, the refreshing sound, and BTS\' vocal delivery. It was also likened to the musical styles of [[Major Lazer]] and [[Justin Bieber]]. It was nominated for the [[Mnet Asian Music Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards]] and appeared on the decade-end lists of the best [[K-pop]] songs by \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' and \'\'[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]\'\'. Commercially, the Korean version of the song debuted at number one on South Korea\'s [[Gaon Digital Chart]], becoming the band\'s first number one on the chart. As of May 2019, the song has sold over 2.5 million copies in South Korea. The Japanese version peaked at number one on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]], becoming the 22nd best-selling single of 2017 in Japan. It received a platinum [[Music recording certification|certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 copies in the country.\n\nTwo [[music video]]s were filmed for "Blood Sweat & Tears", one for the Korean version and another for the Japanese version; the first video was directed by YongSeok Choi and premiered via Big Hit\'s [[YouTube]] channel on October 10, 2016. Inspired by [[Hermann Hesse]]\'s [[Bildungsroman|coming of age novel]], \'\'[[Demian]]\'\' (1919), the symbolism-heavy video depicts BTS exploring a museum and performing choreography. The video was awarded the Best Music Video at the 2017 [[Seoul Music Awards]]. The second video, featuring [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and [[neon colour |neon colour]]s, was uploaded to Universal Japan\'s YouTube channel on May 10, 2017. BTS promoted the song with televised live performances on various South Korean [[Music programs of South Korea|music programs]], including \'\'[[M Countdown|M! Countdown]]\'\', \'\'[[Music Bank (TV series)|Music Bank]]\'\', and \'\'[[Inkigayo]]\'\'.
