It is the third track of the group\'s second studio album, \'\'[[Born Pink]]\'\'.\n\n==Composition==\n“Typa Girl” is a pop/hip-hop song with a unique texture of organ arrangement in the beginning contrasting impressively with the drop bit. The brass tone of the chorus is both stimulating and addictive, and will offer a special flavor to the song. The lyrics confidently speak about being everybody’s “Type,” which come together quite nicely with the modern arrangement. The song highlights the potential of a different type of music.<ref>[https://en.ygselect.com/product/blackpink-2nd-album-born-pink-box-set-ver/7732/category/23/display/1/ YG Select: BORN PINK 곡 소개]</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n\n{{Color|Jisoo}} {{Color|Jennie}} {{Color|Rosé}} {{Color|Lisa}}\n\n<tabber>\n|-|English=\n<poem>\n{{Color lyrics|Rosé|Typa girl that’ll make you wanna dream (Me)}}\n{{Color lyrics|Lisa|Typa girl that came straight off of the screen (Screen)}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jennie|Typa\u2005girl\u2005you wanna ice\u2005up, make me freeze (Ha, ha)}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|Typa girl you\u2005wanna wife up, sign the pre}}\n \n{{Color lyrics|Jennie|I bring money to the table\nNot your dinner\nBoth my body and my bank account\nGood figure\nThinking about me, but there’s nothing to consider\nIf I let you in my circle, you a winner}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Rosé|Didn’t know that you were cold\n‘Til you felt my fire\nHeaven’s gate just opened up\nHearing choirs}}\n{{Color lyrics|Rosé|If you saying something else\nYou a liar}}\n \n{{Color lyrics|Lisa|‘Cause I’m that girl that drive you crazy\nBut you can’t leave me alone\nGot you thinking maybe\nI went supernatural}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jennie|Put you under spells or\nLook into a crystal ball\nI’m not like these other girls at all}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|I’m the typa girl that make you forget that you got a type\nType that make you love me when the only thing you done is like}}\n{{Color lyrics|Rosé|I’m that typa girl\nI’m that typa girl\nI’m that typa girl\nI’m that typa girl}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|Like du-du-dun\nDu-lu-lu-lun\nLike du-du-dun\nDu-lu-lu-lun}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Lisa|I’m the type of girl\nThat everybody type\nDouble tap, tap, tap\nWhat everybody like\nYou can check my stats\nGot everybody’s eye\nAnd I run them laps\nRound everybody’s mind}}\n{{Color lyrics|Lisa|All of these girls on some uppercase shit\nThat mean they all cap\nBeing the best at whatever I do\nThat’s sounding on brand}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Rosé|Typa girl that you wish for when you blow that candle out}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|Typa girl that you wanna take back to your mama house}}\n{{Color lyrics|Lisa|Typa girl that don’t ask for what she wants, she’s takin’ out}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jennie|Typa girl who got bag in same quality as Chanel}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|Now you know that you were cold\n‘Cause you felt my fire\nHeaven’s gate just opened up\nHearing choirs}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|If you saying something else\nYou a liar}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Jennie|‘Cause I’m that girl\nThat drive you crazy\nBut you can’t leave me alone\nGot you thinking maybe\nI went supernatural}}\n{{Color lyrics|Lisa|Put you under spells or\nLook into a crystal ball\nI’m not like these other girls at all}}\n{{Color lyrics|Rosé|I’m the type of girl that make you forget that you got a type\nType that make you love me when the only thing you done is like}}\n{{Color lyrics|Jennie|I’m that typa girl\nI’m that typa girl\nI’m that typa girl\nI’m that typa girl}}\n\n{{Color lyrics|Jisoo|Like du-du-dun\nDu-lu-lu-lun\nLike du-du-dun\nDu-lu-lu-lun}}\n</poem>\n</tabber>\n\n==Audio==\n===Spotify===\n{{Spotify Small|spotify:track:0L8LOav65XwLjCLS11gNPD}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:2022 releases]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Born Pink]]\n[[Category:English songs]]\n[[Category:Explicit Songs]]'}]}}}}
