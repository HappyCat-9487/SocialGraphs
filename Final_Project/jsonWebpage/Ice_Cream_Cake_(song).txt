It is the first track and is used as one of the two title tracks in their first mini-album \'\'[[Ice Cream Cake (mini-album)|Ice Cream Cake]]\'\', the other being "[[Automatic]]". "Ice Cream Cake" was promoted as the "Red" song and "Automatic was promoted as the "Velvet" song.\n\n==Description==\nThe song is described as an electronic song with a mystical music box sound about a young woman who\'s enjoying romance that\'s as sweet as an ice cream cake. It also highlights the cute and lovely side of the members.\n\nThe music video contains many individual scenes of each member, also to show their distinct charm by wearing various outfits and presenting their unique styles. In contrast to the music video of "Automatic", "Ice Cream Cake" is livelier and brighter, with the use of a more fast-paced choreography and brighter colors.\n\n==Composition==\n"Ice Cream Cake" was produced by Hayley Aitken and producing team Trinity Music, which consists of Sebastian Lundberg, Fredrik Haggstam and Johan Gustafson. In December 2012, a 21-second demo version of the song was first spotted during an episode of Swedish TV show Kobra, where Lundberg, Haggstam and Gustafson can be seen processing the demo version which was sung in English. After being purchased by S.M. Entertainment, the song\'s lyrics was rewritten in Korean by songwriter Jo Yoon-kyung and Kim Dong-hyun, with the former whom had been writing for Red Velvet\'s labelmates previously, and the song title changed from its original name of "Ice Cream Truck".\n\nMusically, the song is primarily a dance-pop track with influence from bubblegum pop and drum and bass, which represents the group\'s "Red" side. It was composed in the key of A major with a tempo of 172 beat-per-minute. In addition, it also features "haunted" harmony which can be heard during the intro of the song, while being accompanied by the sound of a music box. The lyrics tell the excitement of a girl being attracted to her boyfriend, using "ice cream cake" as a metaphor to the girl\'s feelings. Two different remix versions of the song were also used for the group\'s promotion, with the first one having an additional dance break section (performed on KBS Music Bank Half-Year Special) and the second one having a longer intro and another dance break section towards the end of the song, while omitting the second verse and chorus of the original version (performed on 2015 MBC Music Festival).\n\n== Charts ==\n=== Weekly chart ===\n{| class="wikitable plainrowheaders sortable" style="text-align:center"\n|-\n! scope="col" | Chart (2015)\n! scope="col" | Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope="row" | South Korea (Gaon Digital Chart)\n|4\n|-\n! scope="row" | US World Digital Song (Billboard)\n|3\n|}\n\n=== Monthly chart ===\n{| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center"\n|-\n! scope="col" | Chart (2015)\n! scope="col" | Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope="row" | South Korea (Gaon Digital Chart)\n|11\n|}\n\n===Year-end Chart===\n{| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center"\n|-\n! scope="col" | Chart (2015)\n! scope="col" | Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope="row" | South Korea (Gaon Digital Chart)\n|46\n|}\n\n==Awards and Nominations==\n\n===Music Show Wins===\n{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:650px;"\n!Song\n!Music Program\n!Date\n|-\n| rowspan="6" |"Ice Cream Cake"\n|\'\'Music Bank\'\'\n|March 27, 2015\n|-\n|\'\'Inkigayo\'\'\n|March 29, 2015\n|-\n|The Show\n|March 31, 2015\n|-\n|\'\'Show Champion\'\'\n|April 1, 2015\n|-\n|\'\'M Countdown\'\'\n|April 2, 2015\n|-\n|\'\'Show!
