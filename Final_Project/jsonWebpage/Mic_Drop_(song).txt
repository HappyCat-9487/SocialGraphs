The Korean version was originally included as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] track on the band\'s fifth [[extended play]], \'\'[[Love Yourself: Her]]\'\' (2017), and later [[remix]]ed by American producer and [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Steve Aoki]]. The remix was released as the second [[single (music)|single]] from the EP on November 24, 2017 by [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and features a guest appearance by American rapper [[Desiigner]]. It was serviced to US [[contemporary hit radio]] on December 5, 2017, as a single in that country. The Japanese-language version of "Mic Drop" was released on December 6, 2017 by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Virgin Records| Virgin Music]] as a triple A-side [[single album]] that included "[[DNA (BTS song)|DNA]]" and a new, original song "[[Face Yourself|Crystal Snow]]", both also in Japanese. Both the Korean and Japanese versions of the song were written by Supreme Boi, [[Bang Si-hyuk|"Hitman" Bang]], [[J-Hope]], [[RM (rapper)|RM]], and [[Pdogg]], with the latter of the five solely handling production. The remix version was also written by the same songwriters, with additional songwriting by Aoki, Desiigner, [[Tayla Parx]], [[Flowsik]], and Shae Jacobs. It was produced by Aoki, with Pdogg providing additional production. A [[hip hop music|hip hop]] song, the lyrics celebrate BTS\' numerous achievements.\n\nThe song received generally favourable reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised its beat, sound, and musical styles, and picked it as a standout track, on \'\'Love Yourself: Her\'\'. Commercially, the remix version of "Mic Drop" debuted at number 28 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]], becoming the band\'s first track to reach the top 40 on the chart. The song appeared at number 37 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] and number 46 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], in addition to reaching moderate peaks in several other territories. The Japanese version debuted at number one on both the [[Oricon Singles Chart]] and the [[Billboard Japan Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Japan Hot 100]]. It was the 13th best-selling single of 2017 in Japan. It was [[Music recording certification|certified]] platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ).\n\nTwo [[music video]]s were filmed for "Mic Drop", one for the Korean remix version and one for the Japanese version. Woogie Kim directed the music video for the Korean version which premiered on Big Hit\'s [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the song\'s release. The video for the Japanese version was uploaded to Universal Music Japan\'s YouTube channel on December 5, 2017. Both videos depict the band performing powerful choreography in various settings.
