It is the first song and title track in the group\'s second mini-album \'\'[[Kill This Love (EP)|Kill This Love]]\'\' under the same name. The single and its music video was released on April 5, 2019 at 12am KST.\n\nIt was highly anticipated due to it ending the ten-month "hiatus" since producing their last Korean mini album \'\'[[Square Up (EP)|Square Up]]\'\' with its title track, "[[Ddu-Du Ddu-Du]]".\n\n==Composition==\nThe song is described by YG Entertainment as being more "intense" than previous BLACKPINK songs but it has a "strong rhythm" like "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", and that the choreography will be more "dynamic" than their previous choreography.\n\nIt is a song with lead brass and powerful drum sounds. The track was completed with the members\' rap and vocals overflowing with charisma. <small>\'\'[Source: Naver]\'\'</small>\n\n==Music Video==\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Hyun Seung Seo and shot in mid-March. It was released simultaneously with the song.

It also set the record for the biggest YouTube Premiere with 979,000 concurrent viewers.\n\nOn April 9, the dance practice video for "Kill This Love" was released on BLACKPINK\'s official YouTube channel.\n\n== Background and Release ==\nOn January 23, 2019 a few months before release Yang Hyun Suk teased at great plans for BLACKPINK in the year of 2019.
