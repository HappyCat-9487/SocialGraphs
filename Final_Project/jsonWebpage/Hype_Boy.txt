It was released on August 1, 2022 with its interactive MV being released on July 23, 2022.\n\n== Background ==\nEvery part of this moombahton/electropop mash-up, including the unique pre-chorus, puts the members\' distinct vocals front and center.\n\n[NewJeans Commentary]\nI think this song shows what makes us chic and different, and it holds your attention to the very end. I hope you can feel how different it is from "Attention." Oh, right! And the song is a combination of several different ideas, so it\'s up to you what you want to take away from it when you\'re listening and watching! And make sure to let me know what you think, okay?<ref>[https://newjeans.kr/boost NewJeans Official Website]</ref>\n\n== Lyrics ==\n{{Lyric box|\n<center>\n{{Color Box|Minji}}&nbsp;{{Color
