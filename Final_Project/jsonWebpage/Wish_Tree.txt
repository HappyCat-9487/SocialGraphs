It is one of the Christmas singles included in a special winter project held from label [[SM Entertainment]], with 2 other singles from labelmates BoA and f(x). Wish Tree was announced to be released as the second single of this project, after f(x)\'s "12:25 (Wish List)" which was released on December 15, 2015, and was released on December 18, before BoA\'s "Christmas Paradise" on December 22. The company has described the song is a pop ballad with a warm feel and an acoustic sound.\n\n==Promotion==\nSM Entertainment released teasers of the songs through their video sharing application, Everyshot. The company also invited fans to join their \'\'Everyshot WINTER GARDEN\'\' league event, wherein fans can make videos with the teasers of the three songs they released and upload it through the app. The contest will be held from December 12 to December 31.\n\nTo further promote the three singles, f(x)\'s Amber & Luna and Red Velvet\'s [[Seulgi]] & [[Wendy]] took part in a one-hour show which was broadcast on the Naver V app an hour before Red Velvet\'s single was released. The four girls discussed their groups\' activities in the past year and promoted the singles, including BoA\'s, alongside their wishes for 2016.\n\nRed Velvet began promotions for Wish Tree on 25 December, Christmas, on KBS\' music program \'\'Music Bank\'\'.\n\n==Music video==\nOn December 22, SM Entertainment released a music video for each song for their \'Smile for U\' campaign.\n\nAnd on February 12, SM Entertainment (with NAVER tvcast playleague support) released another music video for the song that created by Jeong Minseo, who won SM Winter Garden Music Video League.\n\n== Lyrics
