The single was released by [[Big Hit Entertainment]] on April 29, 2015 in South Korea. It was the first of BTS\' career to garner them a win on a [[Music programs of South Korea|South Korean television music show]]. Two remix versions of the song were subsequently released on the band\'s first [[compilation album]] \'\'[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]\'\' in 2016. By September 2016, the song had sold over 800,000 digital downloads domestically. In December 2019, its music video became BTS\' 14th to surpass 200 million views.\n\nA Japanese version of the song was released digitally and in physical format on December 8, 2015 through [[Pony Canyon]] in Japan. The physical single was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ) that same month for selling over 100,000 copies. The digital single received silver certification in June 2021 for surpassing 30&nbsp;million streams. In 2019, \'\'Billboard\'\' ranked "I Need U" as the 80th greatest K-pop song on its list of the 100 Greatest K-pop Songs of the 2010s. [[BBC]] named it one of the songs that truly defined the 2010s, referring to it as the starting point where BTS would become worldwide sensations.<ref name="bbc" />\n\n== Composition ==\n"I Need U" is "an expressive dance track that soars with BTS’ emotive vocals as whistling [[Synthesizer|synths]], reverberating [[hi-hat]]s, and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-inspired riffs build upon one another to create a sense of melodic despondency." The song serves as “the start of one’s young adulthood, in which beauty coexists with uncertainty, and focuses on the uncertain future more than the glamour of youth.” <ref name="billboard">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8543872/bts-i-need-u-songs-that-defined-the-decade|title=Songs That Defined the Decade: BTS\' \'I Need U\'|date=November 21, 2019|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref> The original version of the song is in the key of F minor and 158 beats per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tunebat.com/Search?q=bts&page=2|title=BTS Song Search|publisher=Tunebat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824163524/https://tunebat.com/Search?q=bts&page=2|archive-date=August 24, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe Korean version of the song was not released as a separate single.
