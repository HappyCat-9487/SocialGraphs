The song was [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ). "DNA" received several accolades, including a nomination for Song of the Year at the [[Korean Music Awards|15th Korean Music Awards]] and the [[2017 Mnet Asian Music Awards|19th Mnet Asian Music Awards]].\n\nThe [[music video]] was directed by YongSeok Choi and premiered simultaneously with the release of the song.
