It is a final project for studying K-pop lyrics. We would like to know the lyrics that could attract attention more or appeal to people to listen repeatedly, so we selected many top songs from both the most famous platforms, Melon from locals and Spotify from internationals. In order to find out what type of lyrics could intrigue their interests and the difference between locals\'92 preferences and international types.
